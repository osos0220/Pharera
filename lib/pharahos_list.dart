      "namee": "الملك توت عنخ امون",
      "details": "Tutankhamun, an Egyptian pharaoh, ascended the throne at a young age, around 9 years old, during the 18th dynasty. His reign was brief, from approximately 1332 to 1323 BCE. He is best known for the intact tomb discovered in the Valley of the Kings in 1922, filled with treasures and artifacts, shedding light on ancient Egyptian culture and history. His death at a young age remains a mystery, sparking speculation and fascination for centuries.",
      "explore": "Tutankhamun, often referred to as King Tut, reigned as the Pharaoh of Egypt from approximately 1332 to 1323 BCE during the New Kingdom's 18th dynasty. Although his reign was relatively short and he ascended to the throne at a very young age, his achievements and the historical significance of his reign are notable. Here are some key achievements and contributions of Tutankhamun:\n\n"
          "1. Religious Restoration: One of Tutankhamun's most significant achievements was the restoration of the traditional Egyptian religion and practices that had been altered by his predecessor, Akhenaten, who promoted the worship of Aten, the sun disk. Tutankhamun, under the influence of his advisors, reinstated the worship of the old gods, particularly Amun, and restored the temples and priesthoods that had fallen into disrepair during Akhenaten's monotheistic reforms.\n\n"
          "2. Capital Relocation: Tutankhamun moved the capital back to Thebes from Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), which was established by Akhenaten. This move was part of the broader effort to restore the traditional religious and cultural order.\n\n"
          "3. Economic Recovery: During Tutankhamun's reign, efforts were made to stabilize the economy, which had suffered under Akhenaten's rule. Resources were allocated to repair and rebuild temples, including the temples of Karnak and Luxor, which helped to revitalize the state religion and economy.\n\n"
          "4. Military Campaigns: Although there are limited records of significant military achievements, some inscriptions suggest that Tutankhamun's reign saw some military activity in the form of campaigns to maintain Egypt’s borders and influence, particularly in Nubia and the Levant.\n\n"
          "5. Artistic Flourishing: Tutankhamun's reign saw a continuation and refinement of the artistic styles that characterized the Amarna period. His tomb, discovered in the Valley of the Kings in 1922 by Howard Carter, is a testament to the wealth and artistry of the period, containing numerous finely crafted artifacts, including his iconic gold burial mask.\n\n"
          "6. Tomb Construction: The construction of Tutankhamun’s tomb (KV62) in the Valley of the Kings, though small compared to those of other pharaohs, is one of the best-preserved and most richly furnished tombs discovered. Its treasures have provided invaluable insights into the material culture, craftsmanship, and daily life of ancient Egypt.\n\n"
          "Tutankhamun's death at a young age (around 18 or 19) and the subsequent discovery of his nearly intact tomb in 1922 has greatly contributed to his fame and the understanding of ancient Egyptian civilization. His reign, though brief, played a crucial role in the transitional period of Egyptian history, particularly in the restoration of the traditional religious practices that would continue for centuries."

        "4.

    {"image": "assets/images/akhnton.jpg", "name": "King Akhenaten",
    "namee": "اخناتون",
      "details":"Akhenaten, known for his revolutionary religious reforms, ruled ancient Egypt during the 18th dynasty from around 1353 to 1336 BCE. He introduced monotheistic worship centered on the sun god Aten, shifting away from traditional polytheism. His capital, Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), reflected his new religious ideology. Despite initial prosperity, his reign faced opposition, and after his death, his reforms were largely reversed, and his monuments were dismantled.\n\n"
      "Akhenaten, also known as Amenhotep IV, is one of ancient Egypt's most intriguing and controversial pharaohs, primarily known for his religious reforms and radical changes in artistic style. Here are some of his notable achievements:\n\n"
      "1. Religious Revolution: Akhenaten is most famous for his religious revolution, which involved the elevation of the sun god Aten to the status of the supreme deity and the suppression of traditional Egyptian polytheism. He proclaimed Aten as the one true god and initiated a monotheistic cult centered around the worship of the sun disc. This represented a significant departure from the traditional polytheistic beliefs of ancient Egypt.\n\n"
          "2. Establishment of Akhetaten: Akhenaten founded a new capital city called Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna) dedicated to the worship of Aten. The city was constructed from scratch and served as the administrative and religious center of Egypt during Akhenaten's reign. It featured grand temples and palaces, reflecting the new religious and artistic ideals of the Aten cult.\n\n"
          "3. Artistic Innovations: Akhenaten's reign witnessed a revolution in artistic style known as the \"Amarna art.\" This art style deviated from traditional Egyptian artistic conventions, depicting the pharaoh and his family in a more naturalistic and intimate manner. It emphasized realism, with elongated proportions, exaggerated features, and a focus on the royal family's everyday activities.\n\n"
          "4. Royal Family: Akhenaten's family played a prominent role in his religious reforms and artistic innovations. His wife, Nefertiti, was a powerful and influential queen who played a central role in the Aten cult. Their daughters, especially the famous Ankhesenamun, were also prominent figures in Akhenaten's court.\n\n"
          "5. Diplomacy and Foreign Policy: Akhenaten's reign saw a shift in Egypt's foreign policy, with a focus on diplomacy and pacifism rather than military conquest. He sought to maintain peaceful relations with neighboring powers and engaged in diplomatic correspondence with other rulers, including those in the Hittite Empire.\n\n"
          "6. Literary Contributions: Akhenaten is credited with composing a series of hymns and prayers dedicated to the Aten, known as the \"Great Hymn to the Aten.\" These texts praise the sun god and express Akhenaten's devotion to Aten and his role as the sole mediator between Aten and humanity.\n\n"
          "7. Legacy and Controversy: Despite his significant achievements, Akhenaten's reign ended in controversy, and his religious reforms were largely dismantled by his successors. Nevertheless, his reign represents a fascinating period of experimentation and innovation in ancient Egyptian history, leaving a lasting impact on art, religion, and culture in the Nile Valley."},

At the top, there is a small chamber containing the thirty-second dynasty or the beginning of the Ptolemaic era, which was carried by women and played by shaking it with their hands in religious rituals.
